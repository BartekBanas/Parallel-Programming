# Projects for Parallel Programming classes

This repository contains a collection of small projects focused on parallel programming. The projects cover various aspects of parallel programming techniques and frameworks, including Java Executor Framework, Read-Write Lock implementation in C, OpenMP parallelization in C, and MPI communication in C. Each project showcases different parallel programming concepts and provides examples of parallel computation, concurrent access to shared resources, parallelization of loops, and message-passing communication.

Included projects aren't meant for use but rather for learning and showcasing tools that had been used as well as possibly share how to create Cmake files for linking used libraries.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed before working on such projects or using the ones included here.
